This study presents a multi-faceted approach to predicting car Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) using a variety of popular indicators. We use both categorical and continuous indicators in our regression and classification tasks. Our research in understanding the determinants of MSRP is pertinent to the rapidly evolving automotive sector. The U.S. alone boasts an impressive fleet of approximately 286 million vehicles, encompassing a diverse range of 383 automotive brands. We leverage a dataset sourced from Kaggle comprising various car attributes along with the cars MSRP. The objective of this study is to present a comprehensive approach to understanding and predicting MSRPs of cars based on specific features by weighing their importance to generate an equitable value. By diving into the intricate branch of values, we aim to empower customers, manufacturers, and dealers with a profit-making understanding of what forces shape the price tags of automobiles.
